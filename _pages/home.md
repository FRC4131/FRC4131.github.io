#Iron Patriots#

##FRC team 4131 from Liberty High School##

<b>Welcome to the Iron Patriots' website!</b>

The Liberty High School Robotics Club consists of students ranging from freshman to senior year, some of whom attend other schools than Liberty or participate in the Running Start program. We are excited to be participating in our third year of FIRST.

We are getting ready to start our 5th competition season in the FIRST FRC competition.

If you are interested in joining, please make contact with one of the officers or simply show up at a meeting. Our meeting times along with additional information will be posted in the Blog section on this website.

Thanks to all the mentors, students, and sponsors who make this club possible.
