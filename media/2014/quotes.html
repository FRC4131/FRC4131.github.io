<h1>Build Season Quotes</h1>
<p>Build season is the 6-week period in which we have to build our robot. The short time constraints often result in very tired workers, who are apt to say very silly things. Here are some of the more appropriate examples, as recorded by Ian.</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Put on a pink sparkly jumpsuit that says 'Pink Sparkly Pony Princess.'" <i>Keelan; 1/12/15</i></li>
	<li>"Have you ever played that game where there are llamas, and then they evolve into something else?" <i>Yana; 1/17/15</i></li>
