<h1>Iron Patriots</h1>
<h2>FRC team 4131 from Liberty High School</h2>
<b>Welcome to the Iron Patriots' website!</b>
<p>The Liberty High School Robotics Club consists of students ranging from freshman to senior year, some of whom attend other schools than Liberty or participate in the Running Start program.</p>
<p>We have just finished our fourth build season and are entering our fourth competition season in the FIRST FRC Competition.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining, please make contact with one of the officers or simply show up at a meeting. Our meeting times along with additional information will be posted in the Blog section on this website.</p>
