<b>Welcome to the Iron Patriots' website!</b>

<p>We are almost into our sixth build season in the FIRST FRC Competition.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining, please make contact with one of the officers or simply show up at a meeting. Our meeting times along with additional information will be posted on our <a href="/calendar">calendar</a>.</p>
