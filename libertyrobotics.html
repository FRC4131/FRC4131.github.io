title: What Is Liberty Robotics?
---
<p>Robotics is an exciting club in which the aim is to teach problem solving and leadership skills in a unique and exciting hands-on way that shows what engineering is all about. The goal of the program is to compete in the yearly regional Robotics Competition hosted by FIRST.</p>
<h2>What is FIRST?</h2>
<p>FIRST stands for <b>F</b>or <b>I</b>nspiration and <b>R</b>ecognition of <b>S</b>cience and <b>T</b>echnology. FIRST organization was founded by inventor <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/bio/dean-l-kamen">Dean Kamen</a> (creator of the Segway) in 1989. Its purpose is to develop ways to inspire students in engineering and technology fields. The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST LEGO League, and FIRST Tech Challenge competition. FIRST also operates FIRST Place, a research facility at FIRST Headquarters in Manchester, New Hampshire where it holds educational programs and day camps for students and teachers.</p>

<h2>Why Should I Join Robotics?</h2>
<p>You might be interested in a business, engineering, science or a technology related field.</p>
<p>You want more material to put on your college resume.</p>
<p>You like trying new things.</p>
<p>Robotics introduces you to a fun and exciting group of new people.</p>
<h2>What Does a Typical Robotics Year Look Like?</h2>
<h3>Start of School to January 4th (Pre Build Season):</h3>
<p>Meetings generally include advertising related discussions as well as skill building workshops. Club will usually meet once a week, with the possibility of more than once a week, when build season draws nearer.</p>
<h3>January 4th to February TBD (Build Season):</h3>
<p>On Jan 4th, all the the FIRST teams in our region meet at Auburn High School for the kickoff event, which occurs simultaneously across the globe. At the event, the new FIRST competition game is announced; every year there is a new and unique competition challenge.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of kickoff broadcasts: <a>2012</a> and <a>2013</a>.</p>
<p>During build season, all the teams across the world work toward building a robot that aims to complete the different objectives announced in the challenge. This six week period is a brief and grueling time, and meetings are often held daily for as many hours possible (without distracting too much from other school and family responsibilities).</p>
<p>No student has to achieve a certain mandated amount of hours during this period, but it is highly encouraged that students partake as much as possible during this time. Build season has been described as "the toughest fun you'll ever have".</p>
<p>At midnight on the final day of build season, all teams must literally bag up and seal their robot in preparation for competition. No changes to the robot can be made until the competition.</p>
<h3>Last build day to Competition (Post Build Season I):</h3>
<p>During this time, additional construction can be done to parts outside of the bagged robot, and computer code can be developed and edited. FRC rules state that teams can bring 30 additional pounds of pretofabricated parts to the competition, and during the period of Post Build Season I, the club will focus on construction of these materials.</p>
<p>Meetings are generally less intensive than during Build Season, but students meet once or twice a week.</p>
<h3>Competition(s)</h3>
<p>This year, Washington State is using a new competition model so that teams get to participate in more than one competition, and have better chances of getting to finals. This system will be new for all teams in the area, but competition usually lasts for three days: one practice/final build day and two competition days.</p>
<p>Competitions this year will be hosted by high schools across the state.</p>
<h3>Post competition to End of school year (Post Build Season II):</h3>
<p>Immediately following competition, the robotics club will take several weeks off.  Until the end of the school year, the few meetings can include skill building workshops, but will more than likely focus on planning the start of the next robotics season.</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>Club meetings during the summer are lowtocommitment, and focus on building additional skills for the next season. Students will complete engineering projects, such as 2013's T-shirt cannon.</p>
