This is the second post I have made today. The first is [here](/posts/14/12/31/this-is-a-test).

As you can see with the first post, I'm having trouble getting Jekyll to cooperate.

In the first post, I gave it the full date and time. Then I changed it, and it hasn't updated. Hopefully by getting it right the first time,
this post will appear with just the date.
