title: End of Auburn Mountainview
date: 2015-02-28

This post is to commemorate the conclusion of our first competition, at Auburn Mountainview. We didn't make it to finals, and ended in 27th of 31, which is nothing to really celebrate about.

However, it is above 30th, and we debugged enough problems that we know what we want to do going forward. At the next meeting (on Monday), we will unbag the robot and remove all of the key features and transplant them onto the practice robot. This will allow us infinite time to build, code, and practice. We will use another two hours before our next competition to re-attach all of the components.

With this in mind, we would hope that all of you can put more effort into being at meetings more often. With infinite time to work, there will be near-infinite work to do. Unfortunately, we do not have infinite people to do it, so we need everyone who can be present to be present.
