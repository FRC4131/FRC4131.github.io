This post is to commemorate the conclusion of our first competition, at Auburn Mountainview. We didn't make it to finals, and ended in 27th of 31, which is nothing to really celebrate about.

However, it is above 30th, which was the goal. Along the way, we found a lot of problems and solved most of them too. One of the robot's hooks to carry bins shattered, so we reconstructed them out of metal. Chains slipped, so we changed the sprockets. Motor controllers failed, so we got some new ones, even though they were the wrong type. We made it work.

Statistics have been run, and the conclusion is: we need more points. We were scoring approximately 40 points every game with our alliances, and we need to be getting about 60 from now on to qualify. This will require a lot of work, but it is most certainly possible. We have a plan about what we want to do to score more points.

Unfortunately, a mere plan is not quite enough. We need people there to execute the plan. Tensions are running high, sleep is running low, and you probably haven't seen your friends in a few days. Still, we appreciate every hour, every minute you can put in to get the robot ready.

Tomorrow, on Tuesday, March 3, we will remove all of the components from our competition robot and move them over to our duplicate robot we use for testing. We will then have near-infinite time to work on the robot. Once we have made all of the upgrades we need, and given the drivers ample practice to use them, we will migrate them back over to competition robot. We should them be ready for competition.

With that in mind, here is our upcoming meeting schedule:

|Day|Time|Task|
|:--|:---|:---|
|Tuesday, 3/3|2-6|Return the trailer; remove parts from the competition robot|
|Wednesday and Thursday, 3/4-5|No Meeting| |
|Friday, 3/6|2-10|Attach components to the duplicate robot; start CADding new components|
|Saturday and Sunday, 3/7-8|12-8|Drivers and Software Team have the robot to work on|

With this in mind, we hope to see you as much as possible over the next week!
