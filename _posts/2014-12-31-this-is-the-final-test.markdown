title: This is the Final Test
date: 2014-12-31

I said it, and I mean it. This is the absolutely, completely, totally <b>FINAL</b> test of the blog. It will probably also be the final post today.

The test now is creating a post using just the web editor. Using Git Shell is fine for me, but I know the people in this club; I am one of three people who knows what Git is, and one of two who know how to use it. And I'm the only officer in those categories.

So, in the interest of compatibility with others (a main reason of moving off of the [Wordpress site](http://frc4131.wordpress.com)), I'm testing out the ability to create posts from the web. So far, so good; but it isn't committed yet.

*Update:* after a comedy of errors (file was in the wrong folder, had no extension, and the date format was messed up, causing a build failure), I'd say it works.
