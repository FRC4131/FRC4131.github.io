title: End of Shorewood

This post marks the end of the Shorewood FRC competition. We ended in 21st, six places higher than our first competition, but still not high as we expected or needed. We were not picked for alliance selections, and set as 3<sup>rd</sup> alternate for the alliance matches. We didn't stick around.

Because we weren't selected, we do not have enough points to move on to regionals, the next stage of competition. Our fourth robotics season ends today. However, there is always work to be done. If you feel incredibly committed, or just bored, we invite you to stick around and help some more. On Tuesday, we will be unpacking the trailer full of our competition material. Then, there are any number of side projects being worked on at any given time. Here are a few:

 - <b>T-Shirt Launcher</b>: this topheavy, unsteady box of C-channel no longer exists. The base was taken apart and drastically reduced in height, but has yet to be assembled. There are calls to redesign the robot entirely before it is assembled, which may be heeded.
 - <b>Maintainence on Free Willie</b>: the Aerial Assist robot, Free Willie, still works (the last time we used it), but the control system redesign brought on this year means that the control system is outdated. We may just have to run two versions of the driver station on different computers, or we may need to swap the whole control system. Free Willie is still event-worthy, potentially even more so than this year's robot (still unnamed), so maintaining it would be in our best interests.
 - <b>Octocopter</b>: as a side project over last summer, work was started on a quadcopter for the club to use at events. Parts were ordered to turn it into an octocopter, but work was dropped abruptly once build season started. We will most likely return to building and configuring this copter at some point.
