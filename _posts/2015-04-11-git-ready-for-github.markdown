title: Git Ready for Github!
author: Ian Weiss

Puns aside, our team is going to make a large push to migrate everything to Github over the next year. [The website](/) is already here, media is coming across slowly, software has been here for the past year, and even hardware (in the form of CAD) is being experimentally brought across. There are some pros and cons to Github, although you will quickly see how greatly the former outweighs the latter.

<b>Pros:</b>

 - Everything is available from any computer, not just the school network or your "assigned" working computer
 - Repositories are open to the public, which basically makes the entire world our mentors
 - Version control allows us to access an earlier version of anything, should an update break a feature
 - Open-sourcing code allows us to work on it all the time, even before kickoff and over the summer
 - Mentoring other teams by showing them working code and CAD is almost certainly a boost for a Chairman's Award
 - Going to colleges, you can show your active participation in the club by showing commits with your name on them

<b>Cons:</b>

 - CAD will have to be organized in separate repositories per robot part. Autodesk Inventor CAD files are measured in megabytes, and we hit the 1GB limit very quickly the first time we tried putting CAD up.This should not have any major effects, though, because Inventor can work across folders.
 - Each member will have to create a Github account when they join the club. While this is just one more username and password to remember, every aspect of the club will be accessed through these credentials (once they are migrated).
 - Pushing changes will involve going through Git. Unfortunately, Autodesk does not supply an Inventor plugin for Git compatibility. This means that each member will have to learn the basics of the Git command-line tools. Fortunately, [many](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) [tutorials](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/mastering-github?gclid=CIKnsPW678QCFUZqfgod1YwA2w) [exist](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/), and it is quite simple to use.
